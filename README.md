### About me ###
Experienced programmer, I love dissecting complex problems and creating simple yet equally complex solutions. I work in mostly in C++ and C# but have a soft spot for all languages and frameworks.

### Current Projects ###
Muse - Current UE project I am working on, primarily written in C++ with minimal blueprints. Current prototyping exciting action gameplay mechanics for a third person perspective.
