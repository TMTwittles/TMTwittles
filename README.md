### About me ###
Experienced Australian based programmer, I love dissecting complex problems and creating simple yet equally complex solutions. I work in mostly C++ and C# but have a soft spot for all languages and always looking to learn something new. 

### Current Projects ###
Muse - Current UE project I am working on, primarily written in C++ with minimal blueprints. Currently prototyping exciting action gameplay mechanics for a third person perspective.
